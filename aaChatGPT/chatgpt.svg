  can you output a red rectangle on blue ground in SVG format?
  but you put the red one first, underneath the blue one
  now can you rotate the red rectangle by -20Â°?
  can you make the canvas 500 by 500 and the rectangle 300 by 200?

  Sure! Here's the updated SVG code with a canvas size of 500x500 
  and a red rectangle with dimensions of 300x200:
-->

<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="500" height="500">
  <rect x="0" y="0" width="500" height="500" fill="skyblue"/>
  <rect x="100" y="150" width="300" height="200" fill="salmon" transform="rotate(-20, 250, 250)"/>
</svg>

<!-- 
  In this code, we've updated the width and height attributes of the svg element to 500,
  which sets the size of the SVG canvas to 500x500 pixels. We've also updated the x, y, 
  width, and height attributes of the red rectangle to 100, 150, 300, and 200, respectively, 
  to position and size the rectangle correctly within the larger canvas. Finally, we've applied 
  the same rotate transformation as before to rotate the rectangle by -20 degrees 
  around the center point of the canvas.

      <p>D: This is, strictly speaking, the only real rectangle in the collection, as it is defined by constraining the interior angle &alpha; at three corners (the fourth being 2&pi;-3&alpha;), along with two edge lengths a and b. A form with only right angles having four corners is true only in the Euclidean plane. On a sphere, such an object can have three corners and more than four corners on a hyperbolic surface.</p>
      <p>M: Modifying the angle &alpha; turns the form into an arbitrary quadrilateral, with the fourth angle and lengths c and d calculated to close the shape.</p>
      <p>R: The ability to construct precise angles, or regular subdivisions of the full circle with compass and ruler is a fundamental and foundational principle of all geometry. The “right” angle (90°, or &pi;/2) has a particularly prominent position, is subject of Euclid’s Elements’ 4th postulate, and is inseparably linked to human – especially “man” (Weisman 1992) – made structures, distinguishes the artificial form the natural and is important for civilization and industrialization.</p>
